## Welcome to My Profile! 😁

### Introduction

Hello! I'm Zoom. On most platforms my username is zoomll9833. On GitHub I'm Zoomll.

### Long Story Short...

I got my start on Scratch where I learnt basic coding logic.

I then moved on using Lua in Roblox.

I have now begun to branch out into general programming.

### What I'm Learning Now and In the Future

I'm currently learning Scala and dabbling my toes into web development.

I also want to learn other JVM languages like Kotlin, Groovy, and Java.

The things I'm scared to learn are:
JavaScript: Wayyyy too many libraries...
Java: What the heck is a public static void main string args

I was never really a coffee person...
